[Buy Me That Look: An Approach for Recommending Fashion Products](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11638.pdf)
          
## Introduction
<p align="justify">
Have you ever looked at a model and wondered if you could ever look like him/her? Ever wondered how to develop a good fashion sense? Don't worry this blog has a very elaborate (a bit much if you ask me) solution to both of those questions. The rise of e-commerce websites in India has led to an increase in online shopping throughout the country. Fashion items are the most sought after in the e-commerce market. A robust, effective, and efficient recommendation system for fashion items could lead to an increase in revenue, better customer engagement, and experience. What makes this approach novel is the ability to detect multiple products from a given Product Display page and recommend similar items to the user. A Product Display Page (PDP), is a web-page that presents an image of the product/products worn by a model or a standalone picture of the product in a plain background. This approach helps the user to not only look for the relevant item in a single category but also to match those items with other items that go well with the specified product. In simple words, thanks to the advancements in computer vision, you can copy the look of your favourite celebrity by just using an image of that look.

## Propsed Solution
<p align="justify">
The proposed solution is a Content-Based recommendation system that involves various modules that carry specific tasks that help in achieving the overall goal. For the system proposed in the published article by Myntra the first module consists of the Human Key Point Detection, looks for specific human key points like the ankle and the eyes in order to classify the image as a full-shot image i.e. an image that consists of the full body of a model, however the solution proposed in this blog skips this step, instead we'll recommend items using all the fashion products detected in an image. For better product recommendation we'll first try to determine the gender of the person in the query image. The pose can either be front, back, left, right or detailed. After determining the gender, the input is fed is then fed to the next module, itâ€™s an Object Detection module trained to identify objects from these broad categories - top-wear, bottom-wear, and foot-wear. The goal of this module is not just the identification of these objects in the image but also to localize the objects with bounding-boxes. Once the bounding boxes are obtained for a certain object, that part of the image is cropped and the semantic embeddings for the cropped image are obtained, which will help in identifying similar products from the catalog/database of products whose semantic embeddings are already known. We'll train a Siamese Network for generating the embeddings for the catalog of images. This system helps in automatically and efficiently recommending new items to a user who has selected or shown interest in a certain product display page.

## Data Acquisition
<p align="justify">
To get started with the Fashion Recommendation Engine, we'll need a catalog/database consisting of fashion products to recommend. Unless you have a database of these items lying around we'll need to acquire this data using simple web scraping tools in python. Since we'll focus on recommending items accross various categories we'll need a diverse set of fashion products to populate the database. We can use Myntra's e-commerce website to query images using specific keywords and later save the product details for the results obtained. This way we can categorize products into various sections which would make it easier while recommeding items. We'll use Selenium package from python, its the most popular browser automation tool mainly used to carry out web-product testing. For that we'll require webdriver, for chrome users, you can get it from <a href="https://chromedriver.chromium.org/">here</a>,  make sure the version that you download matches with the version of chrome on your computer. For more details on webscraping e-commerce websites using python follow this article "<a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/web-scraping-e-commerce-sites-using-selenium-python-55fd980fe2fc">Webscraping e-commerce websites using python</a>".  After scraping the image and product urls, you either use it to download the images into your local system or save the image and product urlspair to a flat file and use it later.

```
# import necessary libraries
import time
from selenium import webdriver as wb

# Enter the path to your webdriver's .exe file here
wd = wb.Chrome('chromedriver.exe')

# List of search terms to use for querying from the e-commerce sites
search_terms = ["Mens Topwear", "Womens Topwear", "Mens Bottomwear", "Womens Bottomwear", "Mens Footwear", "Womens Footwear"]

# Define the Maximum number of products you want to scrape per search term
MAX_PRODUCTS_PER_CATEGORY = 1000
image_urls, product_urls = list(), list()
for search_term in search_terms:
    search_term = search_term.lower()
    query = f"https://www.myntra.com/{search_term.replace(' ', '-')}"
    total = 0
    wd.get(query)
    while total < MAX_PRODUCTS_PER_CATEGORY:
        time.sleep(3)
        products = wd.find_elements_by_class_name("product-base")
        for product in products:
            try:
                image = product.find_element_by_tag_name("img")
            except:
                continue
            image_urls.append(image.get_property("src"))
            product_urls.append(product.find_element_by_tag_name("a").get_property("href"))
    try:
        wd.find_element_by_class_name("pagination-next").click()
    except:
        break
```
